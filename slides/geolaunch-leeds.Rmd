## What is this talk about?

This event will comprise a talk by Robin Lovelace from 16:30-17:30 to introduce the newly-published Geocomputation with R, a book on R for geographic data by Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad and Jannes Muenchow. Aimed at people new to the subject, this book shows the power of programming with open source software for high-performance, reproducible mapping and geographic analysis. Robin’s talk will focus on visualisation, which is key to using data to understand the world, and provide some pointers for people wanting to get stuck in and use geocomputation to better understand the world, influence policy – or just have fun with maps! The talk will be followed by drinks and canapes in the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, where you will have the opportunity to talk to Robin about the book.

## Why use geographic data?

- Geographic data is everywhere
- underlies some of society's biggest issues
- Give generalised analyse local meaning

## What is Geocomputation?


.pull-left[

> GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a 'scientific' approach `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/people/s.openshaw/s.openshaw.png")
```
]

--

- But we do differ from early definitions in one important way:

> At the turn of the 21st Century it was unrealistic to expect readers to be able to reproduce code examples, due to barriers preventing access to the necessary hardware, software and data `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2019", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

---

## Another definition

> about harnessing the power of modern computers to *do things* with geographic data.

## Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- **tidyverse** packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensely popular
- Shift in public-facing emphasis:
  - Away from implementation (computational efficiency)
  - Towards user friendliness (productivity)
  
--

There are different types of efficiency (source: [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html#what-is-efficiency))

--

> The second, broader definition of efficient computing is programmer productivity. This is the amount of useful work a person (not a computer) can do per unit time.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# demonstrate incompatibility
# 
# - Historically spatial R packages have been incompatible with the # **tidyverse**
# 
# library(sp)
# dplyr::slice(stplanr::zones, 2) # error
# 
# dplyr::slice(stplanr::zones_sf, 2)
```

## A brief history of geographic packages in R

- See a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luxllb_WAqY) of Roger Bivand's talk on the subject (live demo of [R 0.49](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-0/), released 1997) + GitHub [repo](https://github.com/rsbivand/eRum18/blob/master/eRum_keynote_18.Rmd)

- Brian Ripley, on R's [core team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html), with strong interest in spatial stats

- Rs capabilities have evolved substantially since then!

--

- **rgdal**, released in 2003

--

- **sp**, released 2005
  - **sp**verse: **gstat**, **geosphere**, **adehabitat**

- **raster**, released 2010

---

## Viz developments

"The core R engine was not designed specifically for the display and analysis
of maps, and the limited interactive facilities it offers have drawbacks in this
area" `r Citep(my_bib, "bivand_applied_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

Five years later...

--

"An example showing R's flexibility and evolving geographic capabilities is **leaflet**
`r Citep(my_bib, "R-leaflet", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`,
a package for making interactive maps that has been extended by the R community, as we'll see in Chapter 9" 
`r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

---

## Going way back...

R's predecesor was S, which was itself inspired by lisp `r Citep(my_bib, "chambers_extending_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

This is geographic analysis in S `r Citep(my_bib, "rowlingson_splancs_1993", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`:

```
pts <- spoints(scan('cavities'))
uk()
pointmap(pts,add=T) 
zoom()
uk(add=T) 
pointmap(pts,add=T)
poly<-getpoly() 
```

Still works today, 25 years later:

```{r}
library(splancs)
#> Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Code in S-Plus
#> Version 2 - Spatial and Space-Time analysis
```

---

## splancs

```{r, fig.height=4}
# install.packages("splancs"); library(splancs)
# example, interactive! (commented bits)
data(bodmin)
plot(bodmin$poly, asp=1, type="n")
pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
# zoom()
# pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
```

---

## Observations

- R' is robust and future-proof 

--

- It was hard

--

- But it still worked

---

## Getting data

- Many portals and packages for getting data - see [Chapter 7](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html)

```{r}
library(osmdata)
leeds = getbb("leeds")
osm_data = opq(bbox = leeds) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "leisure", value = "park") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
parks = osm_data$osm_polygons
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.height="200px"}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(parks)
tmap_mode("plot")
```

---

## Getting transport data

- pct package developed to make transport data more accessible

--

- Get transport zones for Leeds

```{r}
zones_all = pct::get_pct_zones("west-midlands")
zones = zones_all[c("geo_code", "car_driver", "foot", "bicycle")]
plot(zones)
```

---

## sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*

---

## Reading and writing spatial data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(sf)
u = paste0("https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/",
  "raw/master/commute/msoa/west-midlands/z.geojson")
zones = read_sf(u)
zones = zones[c("geo_name", "all", "foot", "bicycle")]
```

- `write_sf()` writes data `st_write(zones, 'zones.gpkg')`.

- See supported formats with: `sf::st_drivers()`. Details: Chapter 6 of our book: [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html)

---

## sf class 

```{r}
library(spData) # pre-packaged data
class(zones)
zones
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# ---
## Structure of the sf objects
# world$name_long
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# world$name_long[1:3]
# ```
# 
# ```{r, eval=FALSE}
# world$geom
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# print(world$geom, n = 3)
```

---

## tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

--

- Mostly compatible, but there are some [pitfalls](https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/tidyverse-pitfalls.html)

---

## Chaining geographic operations

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
parks_buff = parks %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 27700) %>%  # uk CRS
  st_buffer(50) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
near_parks = zones[parks_buff, ] # spatial subsetting
zones$near_parks = lengths(st_intersects(zones, parks_buff)) > 0
```

--

```{r}
qtm(zones, "near_parks")
```


---

## Gotchas with geographic data


- Some objects have multiple geometries:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
unique(st_geometry_type(zones))
zones_POLYGON = st_cast(zones, "POLYGON")
unique(st_geometry_type(zones_POLYGON))
```

- Coordinate references systems


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
france = 
st_geometry_type(world)
# Which have more than 1?
## Subsetting contiguous polygons

world_POLYGON = st_cast(world, to = "POLYGON")
near_lnd = world_POLYGON[parks_buff, ]
near_lnd2 = world_POLYGON %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., parks_buff, sparse = FALSE))
plot(st_geometry(near_lnd))
```

# What next?

## Advances in raster data with R

Raster data in R is evolving:

- **raster** package dominates, designed for `Spatial*` objects, e.g. with `as(my_vector, "Spatial")`

- Efforts to bring raster data closer to the **tidyverse**/**sf** approaches, such as [tabularaster](https://github.com/hypertidy/tabularaster), [sfraster](https://github.com/mdsumner/sfraster) + [fasterize](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize)
- [stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars) focusses on multidimensional space-time (raster/vector) is evolving.
- **[terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra)** - first release expected 2019

--

- See https://github.com/edzer/sdsr

```{r, out.width="200px"}
raster::plot(spData::elev)
```

---

## Spatial networks

- Lots of packages out there, including `stplanr`, `dodgr` and `tidygraph`

- Source: https://github.com/spnethack/spnethack

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spnethack/spnethack/master/README_files/figure-gfm/pway-1.png")
```


---

## Geographic 'leverage points' where R can help

A few examples:

--

- Visualising data: e.g [geoplumber](http://www.geoplumber.com/)

--

- To the public - web viz pkgs help with that!

--

- Local issues. E.g. where's the most dangerous/unpopular road in Leeds?

--

- Community cohesion

--


Challenge: balance between innovation and tool overload


Challenge: balance between transparency/simplicity and sophistication of analysis


That is a balance R is ideally set-up to strike

---

## Summary: do things with geographic data in R

Base R + **tidyverse** now (mostly) works with spatial data.

This is thanks to **sf**, a recent package (first release in 2016) that implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

Raster data is also supported, in the more mature package **raster**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("raster")
```


For datasets...:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```
